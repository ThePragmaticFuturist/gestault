# Step 8: Run and Verify**

*   If the development server (`npm run dev`) is still running, your browser should have automatically updated. If not, restart it.
*   You should now see a basic chat interface:
    *   A title bar.
    *   A chat area with the initial "Hello!" message from the assistant.
    *   An input area at the bottom.
*   Try typing a message and pressing Enter or clicking Send.
    *   Your message should appear aligned to the right (blue bubble).
    *   After a short delay, an "Echo:" response should appear from the assistant (grey bubble).
    *   The chat window should scroll automatically.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **API Integration:** Replace the `setTimeout` echo logic in `App.jsx`'s `handleSendMessage` with actual `fetch` calls to your RAG LLM server's API (`POST /api/v1/sessions/{session_id}/messages`).
2.  **Session Management:** Implement logic to create a new session (`POST /api/v1/sessions`) when the app starts or the user wants a new chat, store the `session_id` in the React state, and use it in API calls.
3.  **Error Handling:** Add handling for API errors (e.g., display an error message in the chat).
4.  **Loading Indicators:** Show some visual feedback while waiting for the assistant's response from the backend.
