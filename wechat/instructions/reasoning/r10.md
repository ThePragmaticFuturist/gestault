## Implementing session management ##

Here's a breakdown of the thought process for implementing session management in the React frontend:

1.  **Goal:** The user wants the React app to manage chat sessions. This means:
    *   Creating a new session on the backend when needed (e.g., on app load or user action).
    *   Storing the `session_id` received from the backend in the React component's state.
    *   Using this stored `session_id` in subsequent API calls (specifically when sending messages).
    *   (Future) Allowing the user to explicitly start a new chat (which would trigger session creation).

2.  **Identify Where State Lives:** The `session_id` is relevant to the entire chat conversation within the `App` component. It dictates which conversation thread messages are posted to. Therefore, the `session_id` state should live in the `App` component.

3.  **Identify When to Create a Session:**
    *   **Option A: On App Load:** Create a session immediately when the `App` component mounts. This ensures a session is always ready. This is good for simplicity initially.
    *   **Option B: On First Message:** Only create a session when the user sends their *first* message in a new "instance" of the app. This slightly delays the first API call but might feel marginally cleaner if the user just opens the app and closes it without chatting.
    *   **Option C: Explicit User Action:** Add a "New Chat" button that explicitly triggers session creation.
    *   **Decision:** Option A (on app load) is the simplest starting point. We already have an `ensureSession` function which checks if `sessionId` exists; we just need to call it automatically when the component mounts. Option C can be added later.

4.  **Implement "On App Load" Logic:** How do we run code when a React component mounts? The `useEffect` Hook with an empty dependency array (`[]`) is the standard way.

5.  **Refactor `ensureSession`:**
    *   The current `ensureSession` tries to create a session if one doesn't exist *and* returns the ID.
    *   For the "on load" scenario, we just want to create it and set the state. We don't necessarily need the return value immediately in the `useEffect`.
    *   Let's keep `ensureSession` as is for now, as it's useful within `handleSendMessage`, but call it from `useEffect`.

6.  **Update `App.jsx`:**
    *   Add a `useEffect` Hook.
    *   Inside the `useEffect`, call `ensureSession()`.
    *   Since `ensureSession` is `async`, the `useEffect` callback should also be `async` or use a `.then()` structure. Using an immediately invoked async function expression (IIAFE) inside `useEffect` is a common pattern for this.
    *   Add the empty dependency array `[]` to the `useEffect` so it only runs once on mount.

7.  **Use `sessionId` in `handleSendMessage`:**
    *   The `handleSendMessage` function already retrieves `currentSessionId = sessionId`.
    *   When calling the API endpoint `/api/v1/sessions/${currentSessionId}/messages`, ensure `currentSessionId` (which holds the value from the state) is used. This part was already mostly correct.

8.  **Handle Loading State during Initial Session Creation:** The `ensureSession` function already sets `isLoading(true)`. We need to ensure it sets `isLoading(false)` when done. Add a `finally` block to `ensureSession`.

9.  **Add "New Chat" Functionality (User Action):**
    *   **UI:** Need a button. Place it somewhere logical, perhaps near the title or above the input.
    *   **State:** No new state needed immediately, but clicking the button should reset the `messages` state and clear the current `sessionId` state.
    *   **Logic:**
        *   Create a new function `startNewChat`.
        *   Inside `startNewChat`:
            *   Reset `messages` to the initial assistant greeting.
            *   Set `sessionId` to `null`.
            *   Optionally, immediately call `ensureSession()` again to pre-create the *next* session, or let it happen lazily when the user sends the first message in the new chat. Letting it happen lazily is simpler.
    *   **Connect Button:** Add an `onClick` handler to the new button that calls `startNewChat`.

10. **Refine Styling:** Add basic styles for the "New Chat" button using CSS Modules.

11. **Code Review and Annotation:** Go through the changes, write down the JSX/CSS, and add comments explaining the purpose of each part (state variables, hooks, functions, API calls). Ensure variable names are clear. Double-check async/await usage. Make sure loading states are handled correctly. Ensure error handling in `ensureSession` appropriately updates the UI (e.g., adds an error message).
