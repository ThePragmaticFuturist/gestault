# Thought process for adding error handling and LLM status checks #

Here's the thinking process for adding error handling and LLM status checks to the React frontend:

1.  **Identify Error Points:** Where can things go wrong when interacting with the backend?
    *   **Session Creation:** The initial `POST /api/v1/sessions/` might fail (server down, network error, backend internal error).
    *   **Message Sending:** The `POST /api/v1/sessions/{id}/messages` might fail. Reasons include:
        *   Network error.
        *   Backend server down.
        *   Invalid `sessionId`.
        *   Backend internal error (e.g., during RAG, prompt construction).
        *   LLM backend error (e.g., LLM not loaded/ready, API key invalid, external API down, generation failed).
    *   **LLM Not Ready:** Specifically, the backend might accept the message request but internally find the LLM isn't in a `Ready` state. The backend *currently* returns an `[ERROR...]` message within the *content* of the assistant response in this case, but maybe the frontend should check first or handle this specific error pattern differently.

2.  **Desired User Experience for Errors:**
    *   Don't crash the app.
    *   Provide clear feedback to the user *within the chat interface* that something went wrong.
    *   Re-enable input fields after an error so the user can try again (unless it's an unrecoverable error like session creation failure).
    *   Distinguish critical errors (like session creation failure) from transient ones (like a single message failing).

3.  **Frontend State Needed:**
    *   We already have `isLoading` and `isSessionLoading`.
    *   We might need a specific error state, but displaying errors as assistant messages is simpler initially.
    *   We need access to the LLM status from the backend.

4.  **Checking LLM Status:**
    *   The backend has a `GET /api/v1/models/status` endpoint.
    *   When should the frontend check this?
        *   On initial load? Yes, could be useful to show the user if the backend is ready.
        *   Before sending *every* message? This adds latency. The backend *already* checks the status internally before generating. It returns an error *content* if not ready. So, maybe the frontend doesn't need to pre-check, but rather just handle the specific error *response* from the backend if the LLM wasn't ready. This seems more efficient.
    *   Let's stick with handling the backend's error response first. If the backend successfully stores an assistant message with `[ERROR: LLM not ready...]` content, the frontend just needs to display it (and maybe style it as an error).

5.  **Implementing Error Display:**
    *   We already added an `isError` flag to message objects and corresponding CSS in `MessageBubble`.
    *   In the `catch` blocks of `ensureSession` and `handleSendMessage`, instead of just logging, create an assistant message object with `isError: true` and the error message as content. Add this to the `messages` state.

6.  **Refining `ensureSession` Error Handling:**
    *   Currently, it adds an error message and returns `null`.
    *   In `handleSendMessage`, if `ensureSession` returns `null`, we stop. This seems correct.

7.  **Refining `handleSendMessage` Error Handling:**
    *   The `try...catch` block already exists around the `fetch` call.
    *   Inside `catch`, create the error message bubble.
    *   The `finally` block correctly sets `isLoading = false`.

8.  **Handling Backend's "LLM Not Ready" Error Message:**
    *   The backend currently sends a 201 Created response containing the assistant message, even if the content is `"[ERROR: LLM not ready...]"`.
    *   The frontend will receive this successful response and add the message.
    *   Do we want to style this specific error differently? We could check the `content` string for `"[ERROR:"` and set the `isError` flag dynamically.

9.  **Code Implementation Plan:**
    *   Modify the `catch` block in `ensureSession` to add the error message to the `messages` state.
    *   Modify the `catch` block in `handleSendMessage` to add the error message to the `messages` state.
    *   Modify the success path in `handleSendMessage` to check if the received `assistantMessageData.content` starts with `"[ERROR:"`. If so, add `isError: true` to the message object before adding it to the state.
    *   Ensure `isLoading` is always set to `false` in `finally` blocks for both functions where it's set to `true`.

10. **Review and Refine:** Read through the updated code, ensuring state transitions are correct and the logic covers different failure points. Double-check that inputs get re-enabled after errors. Make sure the check for the backend-generated error message pattern is robust.
