## Implementing the document upload and processing functionality ##

1.  **Understand the Goal:** The user wants to upload documents (various types), process them (extract text, chunk), store metadata (in SQLite), and prepare them for vector embedding (which will likely happen in a subsequent step, but we need the text chunks ready). The processing should happen in the background to avoid blocking the API response.

2.  **Identify Key Components:**
    *   **API Endpoint:** Need a way for users to send files to the server (HTTP POST). FastAPI is the tool. Need to handle file uploads.
    *   **File Handling:** Receive the uploaded file, potentially save it temporarily (or process in memory if small enough, but saving is safer for larger files), determine its type.
    *   **Text Extraction:** Based on file type, use the appropriate library (`python-docx` for .docx, `pypdf` for .pdf, `beautifulsoup4` for .html/.xml, maybe `docling`, or just basic read for .txt). Need to install these.
    *   **Chunking:** Split the extracted text into manageable pieces suitable for embedding and RAG. Need a chunking strategy (e.g., fixed size, recursive character splitting). Need a library for this (like LangChain's `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` or write a simple one).
    *   **Metadata Storage (SQLite):** Store information about the original document (filename, ID, status, timestamps) in the `documents` table. Update status during processing. Store chunk information (text, document ID, chunk index) in the `document_chunks` table.
    *   **Background Processing:** Upload processing can be slow. Don't make the user wait. Use FastAPI's `BackgroundTasks` for simple background jobs or potentially a more robust task queue (like Celery or ARQ) for heavier workloads (start with `BackgroundTasks` for simplicity).
    *   **Error Handling:** What if the file type is unsupported? What if extraction fails? What if chunking fails? Update the document status in SQLite accordingly.
    *   **Unique IDs:** Need a way to generate unique IDs for documents and chunks (UUIDs are good).
    *   **Configuration:** Add settings for temporary upload directories, maybe chunking parameters.
    *   **API Response:** The upload endpoint should respond quickly, indicating the document is being processed and returning the document ID. A separate endpoint might be needed to check the processing status.

3.  **Design the API Endpoint (`/api/v1/documents/upload`):**
    *   Method: `POST`
    *   Input: `UploadFile` (FastAPI's way to handle file uploads).
    *   Output: JSON response with `document_id` and a message like "Upload received, processing started."
    *   Needs access to `BackgroundTasks` and the database.

4.  **Design the Processing Logic (Background Task):**
    *   Input: Temporary file path (or file content), document ID, filename.
    *   Steps:
        *   Update document status to `processing` in SQLite.
        *   Identify file type.
        *   Extract text using the appropriate library. Handle extraction errors.
        *   Chunk the text. Handle chunking errors.
        *   Generate unique IDs for each chunk.
        *   Save document metadata (filename, etc.) and chunk data (text, index, document_id) to SQLite `documents` and `document_chunks` tables. Use batched inserts if possible for performance.
        *   Update document status to `chunked` or `pending_embedding` (or `failed` if errors occurred) in SQLite. Store error messages if any.
        *   Clean up the temporary file.
    *   This logic should be in a separate function triggered by the background task runner.

5.  **Choose Libraries:**
    *   FastAPI: Already chosen.
    *   `python-docx`: For `.docx`.
    *   `pypdf`: A common choice for `.pdf`. (Considered `PyMuPDF` too, but `pypdf` is often simpler to start with).
    *   `beautifulsoup4`: For HTML/XML (though this might be less common initially, good to include). `lxml` is needed as a parser for BS4.
    *   `langchain_text_splitters`: Provides good text splitting implementations (simpler than writing custom logic initially). Install `langchain-text-splitters`.
    *   `uuid`: Standard Python library for unique IDs.
    *   `python-magic`: Useful for reliably detecting file types based on content, not just extension (more robust). Needs system libraries (`libmagic`).

6.  **Refine Database Schema:** The existing `documents` and `document_chunks` tables look mostly suitable. Ensure `processing_status` has clear states (`pending`, `processing`, `chunking`, `chunked`, `embedding`, `completed`, `failed`). Add `file_type` column to `documents` table? Maybe store it in metadata JSON instead. Start without it.

7.  **Structure the Code:**
    *   Create a new directory `app/api/endpoints/`.
    *   Create `documents.py` within that directory for document-related endpoints.
    *   Create a `services/` directory at the project root.
    *   Create `document_processor.py` within `services/` to hold the extraction, chunking, and DB interaction logic. This keeps the endpoint clean.
    *   Update `app/main.py` to include the new router from `documents.py`.
    *   Update `core/config.py` for any new settings (like upload directory).

8.  **Write the Code (Iterative Process):**
    *   **Dependencies:** Add new libraries to `requirements.txt` and install.
    *   **Config:** Update `Settings` in `core/config.py`.
    *   **Service (`services/document_processor.py`):**
        *   Define `extract_text` function (handles different types).
        *   Define `chunk_text` function (uses `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`).
        *   Define `process_document_upload` function (orchestrates steps, takes file path, doc_id, etc., interacts with DB). Needs async DB access.
    *   **API Endpoint (`app/api/endpoints/documents.py`):**
        *   Create the FastAPI router.
        *   Define the `/upload` endpoint function.
        *   Use `UploadFile`, `BackgroundTasks`.
        *   Generate document ID (UUID).
        *   Save the uploaded file *temporarily*. Create a unique temporary filename.
        *   Insert initial record into the `documents` table (status=`pending`). Use `database.execute()`.
        *   Enqueue the `process_document_upload` function using `background_tasks.add_task()`.
        *   Return the response.
    *   **Main App (`app/main.py`):** Import and include the documents router.
    *   **Database:** Ensure `database.py` provides the async `database` object needed by the service.

9.  **Testing and Refinement:**
    *   Run the server.
    *   Use the `/docs` UI or `curl` to upload different file types (.txt, .docx, .pdf).
    *   Check the server logs for processing messages.
    *   Check the SQLite database (`data/rag_server.db`) using a tool like DB Browser for SQLite to verify records are created in `documents` and `document_chunks` tables and the status updates correctly. Check for error messages if uploads fail.
    *   Refine error handling, logging, and status updates. Consider edge cases (empty files, very large files, corrupted files). Ensure temporary files are deleted.
