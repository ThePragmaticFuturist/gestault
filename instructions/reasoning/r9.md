## Add endpoints to monitor the server's system resources. ##

**Plan:**

1.  **Identify necessary libraries:**
    *   `psutil`: A cross-platform library for retrieving information on running processes and system utilization (CPU, memory, disks, network, sensors). This is the standard choice.
    *   `pynvml`: (Optional) For detailed NVIDIA GPU monitoring (memory usage, utilization, temperature). This requires the NVIDIA drivers and the NVML library to be installed on the system. We should make its usage optional/conditional.

2.  **Define API Response Models:** Create Pydantic models to structure the system status information (CPU, RAM, Disk, GPU).

3.  **Create Service Functions:** Write functions (likely synchronous, as `psutil` calls are generally fast and might be CPU-bound) to gather the system data using `psutil` and `pynvml` (if available).

4.  **Create API Endpoints:** Build FastAPI endpoints that call the service functions and return the status information using the defined response models.

5.  **Integrate Router:** Add the new system status router to `main.py`.

**Refinement on GPU Monitoring:**

*   Detect `pynvml` availability.
*   If available, try to initialize it and fetch GPU data.
*   If not available or initialization fails, gracefully omit GPU information from the response or indicate it's unavailable.
*   Wrap `pynvml` calls in `try...except` blocks as initialization or queries can fail.
*   Remember to call `pynvml.nvmlShutdown()` when done, ideally during server shutdown, although for a simple status check, initializing/shutting down each time might be acceptable but less efficient. Let's try initializing once and keeping the handle if possible, or initialize/shutdown per request for simplicity first. Per-request might be safer if errors occur.

**Refinement on Temperature:**
*   `psutil.sensors_temperatures()` might provide CPU/other temps, but it's highly platform-dependent and might require specific setup or permissions. We should include it but note its potential unavailability.

**Models Structure:**

*   `CPUStatus` (usage_percent, core_count_logical, core_count_physical, current_frequency, max_frequency)
*   `MemoryStatus` (total_gb, available_gb, used_gb, used_percent)
*   `DiskStatus` (path, total_gb, used_gb, free_gb, used_percent) - Could be a list for multiple partitions.
*   `GPUStatus` (driver_version, name, memory_total_mb, memory_used_mb, memory_free_mb, utilization_percent, temperature_celsius) - Could be a list for multiple GPUs.
*   `SystemStatusResponse` (cpu, memory, disks: List[DiskStatus], gpus: List[GPUStatus], temperatures: Optional[Dict])
